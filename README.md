# HotPan - Distributed Graph Database

I am attempting to build a database that can

- Store very large graphs
- Operate on them - crud nodes, crud edges
- Use multiple machines for stroage and operations

This is the initial scope. Once I achieved optimally I will work on adding traversal algorithms.
